# bun-lockb README

View and compare [Bun](https://bun.sh/)'s `bun.lockb` files directly in vscode!

Note: Bun must be installed for this to work!

Also Note: Views do not update live! You must close and reopen the file to see changes. 

## How it works

For single files, `bun.lockb` files can be directly executed to produce a yarn-lock-like description of their contents. This does that.

In the diff case, some dirty dirty tricks are needed. See the source. You'll enjoy it.
